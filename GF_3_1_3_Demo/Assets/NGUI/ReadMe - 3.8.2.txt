 FreeType Library
------------------

NGUI version 3.5.2 onwards includes the pre-compiled C++ FreeType library, which is an open source project (http://freetype.org/)
FreeType license: http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/tree/docs/FTL.TXT
This library is used only if you choose the "Generate Bitmap" font option in the Font Maker,
and it will not be included in the build of your game. It's only used in the editor.

*** WARNING ***
PLEASE BACK UP YOUR PROJECT BEFORE UPDATING!
3.0.0 is a major changeset. You will need to open and re-save all of your scenes and prefabs after updating!
After updating, expect some things to no longer work the same way they used to. Widgets scale is no longer
used as its size, so any code that you had relying on this will need to change to use 'width' and 'height'.
You can also expect compile errors related to delegate usage. The following links may help you:
